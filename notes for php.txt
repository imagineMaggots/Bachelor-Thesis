For Developing .php-Scripts locally you can simply download PHP via Winget (assuming you've installed Winget).

To list all available Programs that include "php" in their name you can use your Shell:
	winget search php

From here you can look for a Program named something like "PHP.PHP.8.4". This will be the exact version of PHP that's going to be installed.
	winget install -y PHP.PHP.8.4

This is the Command for Hosting PhP-Server locally (note: the $filepath should obv. be replaced with the path to your index.php):
	php -S localhost:8000 -t $filepath

The URL is going to be highlighted in the Terminal. 



This is a little Hello World Example, that also includes a simple If-Else-Statement.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>PHP: Hypertext-Preprocessor</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2><?php echo "Hello World"?></h2>
        <div>
            <?php
                $x = 1;
                echo "Test $x <br>";

                if ($x == 1)
                {
                    echo "$x";
                }
                else 
                {
                    $x-=2; 
                    echo "$x";
                }
            ?>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
